# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sonsoles

🎓 Dual Bachelor's in Computer Science & Business @ UC3M  
🌍 Erasmus @ INSA Rouen · 🇫🇷 DELF B2 · 🇬🇧 Cambridge Advanced  
💼 Data & AI Intern @ Accenture – Optimization, ML & high-impact delivery

---

### 🚀 Industry Experience

- **Transport Optimization Platform**  
  Developed a Transport Optimization tool for supply chain clients, including input data pipeline design, processing, mathematical modeling, and solution implementation in Pyomo.    Applied advanced linear programming techniques and visualized results using Streamlit to support data-driven decision-making.
- **Genetic Algorithm Refactor**  
  Improved an internal Genetic Algorithms library, enhancing performance and usability to support optimization projects across more than five departments. Facilitated collaboration and accelerated solution development.


### 🧠 What I like building

- Robust, purposeful software that solves real-world problems.  
- Systems that are simple, scalable and easy to maintain.  
- Automation-first solutions using CI/CD and containerization.  
- Products that combine usability, impact and technical elegance.


### 📚 Selected Academic & Personal Projects

- **ML Pipeline: Wind Forecasting**  
  End-to-end regression system using Scikit-learn for renewable energy prediction. Includes EDA, feature engineering, tuning and deployment.

- **Clustering Stars**  
  Built a custom clustering algorithm to group astronomical objects. Compared with classical unsupervised ML techniques.

- **Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System**  
  Developed a multithreaded server in C with a Python client using custom TCP protocol. Focused on concurrency and protocol design.

- **IoT Digital Twin**  
  Connected Raspberry Pi devices to Google Cloud via MQTT. Simulated digital twins using Dockerized components.

### 💡 Engineering mindset

- **Clarity over cleverness**: Prioritize readable, maintainable code.
- **Simplify relentlessly**: Remove complexity unless it's absolutely necessary.
- **Own the result**: I take full responsibility from idea to deployment.
- **Think in systems**: Build for reuse, testability, and scale.


### ✨ About me

Curious and driven engineer passionate about optimization, ML, and building useful systems.  
I thrive in high-trust, ambitious teams and always look for the "why" behind the "what".
