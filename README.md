### 🚀 Industry Experience

- **Transport Optimization Platform**  
  Developed a Transport Optimization tool for supply chain clients, including input data pipeline design, processing, mathematical modeling, and solution implementation in Pyomo.    Applied advanced linear programming techniques and visualized results using Streamlit to support data-driven decision-making.
- **Genetic Algorithm Refactor**  
  Improved an internal Genetic Algorithms library, enhancing performance and usability to support optimization projects across more than five departments. Facilitated collaboration and accelerated solution development.


### 🧠 What I like building

- Robust, purposeful software that solves real-world problems.  
- Systems that are simple, scalable and easy to maintain.  
- Automation-first solutions using CI/CD and containerization.  
- Products that combine usability, impact and technical elegance.


### 📚 Selected Academic Projects

- **ML Pipeline: Wind Forecasting**  
  End-to-end regression system using Scikit-learn for renewable energy prediction. Includes EDA, feature engineering, tuning and deployment.

- **Clustering Stars**  
  Built a custom clustering algorithm to group astronomical objects. Compared with classical unsupervised ML techniques.

- **Peer-to-Peer File Sharing System**  
  Developed a multithreaded server in C with a Python client using custom TCP protocol. Focused on concurrency and protocol design.

- **IoT Digital Twin**  
  Connected Raspberry Pi devices to Google Cloud via MQTT. Simulated digital twins using Dockerized components.
  
- **Donkey Kong with Pyxel**  
  Designed and coded a retro-style platformer game using Python and the Pyxel game engine. Includes animations, collision logic, and pixel-based gameplay.

- **Ubiquitous Shopping Assistant**  
  Mobile web app for elderly shoppers. Combines QR scanning, NFC, voice commands, and real-time support via WebSockets. Designed with accessibility-first UX.
